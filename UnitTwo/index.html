		<h1>Desiree Hoolahan Unit Two Project</h1>

		<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
		<p>This is not an easy question, it’s like asking an enthusiast, ‘what is your favorite automobile?’ The hard part is deciding which category, as my favorite Classic, Muscle, American, Exotic, Luxury, etc. would all be different cars! ;-p
		I am most inspired by Facebook (social networking,) YouTube (media sharing,) Wikipedia (reference,) BBC (news,) Craigslist (active community,) Angie’s List (reviews,) IMDB (entertainment,) and various other sites. I am inspired by these sites because of their ability to produce revenue, popularity, function and usability. I will pick BBC and Wikipedia for the purpose of this exercise.</p>

		<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
		<p><a href="http://www.wikipedia.org" target="_blank">Wikipedia:</a>After selecting your country, the page is text heavy yet balanced.  Focus is barely notable within text heavy areas and the eye tends to focus on any images on the page. Navigation fields stand out on the left side of the site. Search of content on the site is to the top right with log-in actions. Categories of articles are highlighted with blue link text within a ‘header’ field that I feel has an odd use of negative space; Logo/brand seems redundant in this location and the space could be used more clearly using call to action items. Margins are even and negative space is scarce on the page but most prevalent at the top of the page where I would think more call to action items could be placed.</p>
		<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com"target="_blank">BCC:</a> Focus is on images, which are large and mostly advertisements underneath a header with navigation tabs. Very visual heavy, no titles exist outside of a photo until the user scrolls down to reveal a consistent right side column including ads and large focal points, with two columns of equal size containing article titles and photos to the left. There are equal amounts of negative space in the left and right margins and content flow varies as the user scrolls down.</p>

		<h2>What makes them similar or different?</h2>
		<p>Similarities: BBC and Wikipedia are visually polar opposite sites, I cannot think of a similarity in design besides the logo in the top left and the search bar in the far right.</p>
		<p>Differences: Wikipedia is user provided and managed content in a text heavy format. Very reference themed with very few visual stimulations until an article is selected. The user has to have an idea of what they are looking for already when using Wikipedia. BBC News uses visual focal points to drive the user to content. A user can easily entertain themselves just scrolling through titles on BBC without leaving the home page.</p>
