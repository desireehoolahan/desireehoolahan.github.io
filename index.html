  <h1>All About Desiree Hoolahan</h1>

  <h2>Brief Summary</h2>
  <p>I am a resigned Executive Assistant, now stay at home mom, living in Woodinville, WA. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because it will boost my skillset when I am prepared to return to my career, which has been at large software, IT and telecommunications companies, as well as allow me to pursue my personal professional goals. In my most recent professional role I was able to provide back up support to Microsoft CIO (at that time, Anthony Scott) whom taught me a lot about optimizing the business of IT, the future of cloud services, real time enterprises and big data management.</p>

  <h2>My Mission</h2>
  <p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as an entrepreneur within my own company because I like to work in a leadership roles and have lots of vision. My dream is to one day use my career based IT knowledge to achieve my personal goal in the ‘green’ market.</p>

  <h2>Details About Me</h2>
  <p>I have greatly enjoyed working at large Tech companies over the past 8 years and truly flourished in managing the business side of IT. I started working while attending college online and raising my son, since my career resulted in faster progression and pay, I made the decision to pause my education. At times I regret the decision and at times I am thankful I was able to network, obtain career goals like my Greenbelt and eventually resign to stay at home with my daughter. I have no regrets on that last item; I have fully enjoyed being here for all her firsts these past two years, and am very thankful to now be in a situation where I am not required to work so I can focus on my educational goals.</p> 
  <p>Recently family commitments keep me busy and I am frequently working on projects to assist my husband’s family operated commodities business in Seattle, Bellevue and Lynnwood. My passions are organic gardening, clean/chemical free living and self-sustaining energy. One day I hope to help make ‘green’ living more convenient and socially desired through effective marketing and web based services.</p>
